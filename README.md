## üõ† Editing the Project

### Main Files to Edit:
1. **Homepage: `src/pages/home/Home.jsx`**  
   - Update your name, role, and introduction text:
     ```jsx
     <h1>[Your Name Here]</h1>
     <h1>[Your Role Here, e.g., 'Frontend Developer']</h1>
     ```
   - Replace placeholders like `[Replace this with your social link]` with actual content.

2. **Work Page: `src/pages/work/Work.jsx`**  
   - Add or edit your projects in `src/pages/work/items.js`. Example:
     ```javascript
     const workItems = [
       {
         workId: 0,
         workName: "Project Name",
         workImg: "./assets/img.jpg", // Add your project image
         bgColor: "#ffffff", // Background color
         workClient: "Client Name",
         workRole: "Your Role (e.g., Developer)",
         workType: "Project Type (e.g., Web App)",
       },
     ];
     export default workItems;
     ```

3. **Styling: `src/pages/home/home.css` and `src/pages/work/work.css`**
